### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Nick DeMarco

A WCSU computer science soon-to-be graduate; a science nerd; a musician. 

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/Ndemco/task-manager-backend">task-manager</a> app. I would like to perhaps turn this into an "Organize Your Life" (name pending) app that allows you to not only schedule tasks and set goals, but help you budget your expenses and save money. My vision is to make this a hub to help keep your life on track, on task, and in budget.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C# and .NET, forever a student of C++ and SQL.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about C++, Beethoven, General Relativity.
